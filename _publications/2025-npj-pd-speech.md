This work introduces a speech-based Parkinson’s disease screening framework using English pangram utterances from $\mathbf{1,306}$ participants. By fusing semi-supervised Wav2Vec2 and ImageBind speech embeddings into a multimodal classifier, the model achieved $\mathbf{\sim89\%}$ AUROC and $\mathbf{\sim86\%}$ accuracy, with strong external robustness.
