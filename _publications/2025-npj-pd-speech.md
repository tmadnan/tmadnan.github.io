This work introduces a speech-based Parkinson’s disease screening framework using English pangram utterances from 1,306 participants. By fusing semi-supervised Wav2Vec2 and ImageBind speech embeddings into a multimodal classifier, the model achieved ~89% AUROC and ~86% accuracy, with strong external robustness.
