We introduce **Hi5**, a synthetic hand pose estimation dataset of 583,000 images generated without human annotation, leveraging high-fidelity 3D hand models with diverse genders and skin tones, dynamic environments, and consumer-grade rendering. The data synthesis pipeline precisely controls pose diversity and representation, enabling robust model training. Models trained on Hi5 outperform real-data baselines on occluded and perturbed real benchmarks, demonstrating synthetic data’s potential for scalable hand pose estimation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
