We developed a facial micro-expression analysis framework to distinguish Parkinson’s disease (PD) using short smile videos with high classification accuracy and generalizability across international cohorts. The model attained ~88% accuracy using only consumer-grade cameras, demonstrating remote, accessible PD screening potential.
