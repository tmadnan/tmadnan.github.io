PARK is a web-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool for remote screening of Parkinson’s disease (PD) using video and audio recordings collected via webcam, including speech, facial expressions, and motor tasks. The system was evaluated on $\mathbf{1,865}$ participants across diverse demographic groups and settings, including supervised clinical environments and unsupervised home use. PARK achieved consistent performance with accuracy ranging from $\mathbf{80.2\%–80.6\%}$ and AUROC between $\mathbf{0.85–0.87}$ on multiple independent test sets, and demonstrated high agreement with movement disorder specialists on held-out assessments. The model generalized well across age, sex, and ethnic subgroups, included uncertainty-aware predictions to support safe use in unsupervised environments, and showed favorable usability and participant satisfaction, highlighting its potential as an accessible, scalable tool for remote PD screening.
