We propose **UACD**, a novel method for identifying the most influential spreaders in large social networks by combining user-specific attributes with topological structure. Unlike traditional global centrality methods, UACD uses only local node information and offers scalability to large graphs, while maintaining higher accuracy. A distributed implementation on Amazon EC2 shows that UACD is on average **12.5% more accurate** and **175× faster** than state-of-the-art alternatives for influence ranking on large Twitter datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
