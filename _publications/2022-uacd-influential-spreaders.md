We propose **UACD**, a novel method for identifying the most influential spreaders in large social networks by combining user-specific attributes with topological structure. Unlike traditional global centrality methods, UACD uses only local node information and offers **scalability to large graphs** while maintaining superior ranking performance. A distributed implementation on Amazon EC2 shows that UACD is on average **$\mathbf{12.5\%}$ more accurate** and **$\mathbf{175\times}$ faster** than state-of-the-art alternatives for influence ranking on large Twitter datasets.
