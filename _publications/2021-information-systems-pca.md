We propose a fast, scalable geo-distributed principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm that efficiently computes PCA on extremely high-dimensional data without intermediate memory overflow by dividing blocks of data and minimizing communication overhead. The method handles $10\times$ higher dimensionality with $2.9\times$ less time compared to baselines, enabling practical deployment in distributed big data settings. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
