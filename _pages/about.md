I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Rochester (ROC-HCI Lab), where my research focuses on multimodal learning for AI-driven healthcare. I develop scalable frameworks for automated screening and personalized management of Parkinson’s disease (PD), using video and audio analysis to enable remote, accessible assessments that lower barriers to specialty care.

My current work centers on three directions:
- **Remote PD screening** using webcam-based facial, speech, and motor assessments.
- **Longitudinal digital biomarkers** that track symptom severity over time from task-based recordings.
- **LLM-powered assistants** that contextualize severity trends, medication history, and lifestyle factors to support individualized PD management.

Before starting my PhD, I served as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at BUET, working at the intersection of distributed systems, big data analytics, and applied machine learning. Across these projects, my long-term goal is to translate AI methods into reliable, user-centered tools that meaningfully support patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems.
