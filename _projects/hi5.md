We introduce **Hi5**, a large synthetic dataset and data synthesis pipeline for 2D hand pose estimation that requires *no human annotation*, enabling diverse and accurate model training with only consumer-grade hardware. <!--more-->
- Developed a **data synthesis pipeline** using high-fidelity 3D hand models, diverse genders and skin tones, and dynamic environments to generate realistic 2D hand images with automatic keypoint annotation.   
- Constructed the **Hi5 dataset** comprising ~583,000 labeled images, produced in 48 hours on a single consumer computer with full pose annotations.   
- Demonstrated that models trained on Hi5 **perform competitively on real hand pose benchmarks** and show robustness under occlusions and varied conditions.   
- Illustrated **cost-effective synthetic data generation** as a viable alternative to expensive manual annotation, expanding accessibility for pose estimation research.
