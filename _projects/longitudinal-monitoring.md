Building a remote monitoring framework that tracks digital severity trajectories over time and aligns them with clinical scores, medication states, and self-reported symptom burden.
- Monthly multimodal assessments via ROUTE-PD dataset (12-month repeated measurements)
- Predict digital severity trends and correlate with neurologist-rated UPDRS changes
- Model intra-individual progression using ranking, linear-mixed, and temporal regression methods
- Identify digital markers that reflect symptom fluctuations and medication effects between visits
