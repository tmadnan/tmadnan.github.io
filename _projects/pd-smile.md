We developed an **AI-based screening framework that detects Parkinson’s disease from brief smile videos captured on a smartphone or webcam**, demonstrating high accuracy and broad applicability, including in diverse population samples. <!--more-->
- Collected **one of the largest annotated smile–video datasets** to date, involving participants with and without PD from multiple settings. 
- Extracted facial landmarks and motion features indicative of hypomimia (reduced facial expressivity), a hallmark PD motor symptom.
- Trained and validated machine learning models achieving **≈88% accuracy** for distinguishing PD from non-PD using only smile videos.
- Demonstrated generalizability in external validation cohorts, including clinical and international datasets.
- Showed the approach is **scalable and accessible**, enabling remote, low-cost initial screening that could complement traditional clinical evaluations and improve early detection access.
