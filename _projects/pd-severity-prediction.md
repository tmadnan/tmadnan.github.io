Developing a model that predicts clinician-rated MDS-UPDRS Part III severity from task-based video recordings, enabling objective, at-home motor assessment.
- Extract multimodal digital biomarkers from finger-tapping, smile/facial movement, and speech tasks
- Predict continuous clinical severity scores using regression and multitask modeling
- Evaluate model reliability across medication states, PD stages, and demographic strata
- Integrate temporal consistency checks to prepare for longitudinal deployment
