We developed and evaluated a **user-centered teleneurology platform** designed to empower individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) by offering remote access to screening tasks, educational resources, and responsive interfaces. <!--more-->
- Designed a web-accessible PD support system integrating speech, motor, and facial mimicry tasks for remote interaction and self-exploration. 
- Incorporated interactive components such as a GPT-driven chatbot, local neurologist finder, and actionable PD prevention/management resources. 
- Conducted a user validation study with 91 participants (including people with and without PD) to assess usability and experience. 
- Achieved above-average usability outcomes and positive feedback, informing iterative improvements and future remote PD care research.
